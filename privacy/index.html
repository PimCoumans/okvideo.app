          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Last updated: 10/06/2024</p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            pixelrock built the OK Video app as a Free app with Paid In-App Purchases. This SERVICE
            is provided by pixelrock at no cost, but includes extra features that are available for
            purchase, and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding
            our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone
            decided to use our Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Log Data</h2>
          <p>
            OK Video does not contain any crash/analytics libraries. Whenever you use OK Video, in a
            case of an error in the app, Apple may send us the crash log. We only receive this Log
            Data when you have explicitly chosen to enable it in your iPhone’s Privacy settings.
            This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
            utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
            statistics.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
            identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
            stored on your device’s internal memory. OK Video does not use these “cookies.” However,
            the app may link to external sites that use “cookies” to collect information and improve
            their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know
            when a cookie is being sent to your device.
          </p>

          <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
          <p>
            OK Video may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will
            be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us.
            Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We
            have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
            practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>

          <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            OK Video does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone. In
            the case we discover that someone has provided us with personal information, we will
            immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
            has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to
            do necessary actions.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
            page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are
            posted on this page. You can find the last updated date at the top of this page.
          </p>
