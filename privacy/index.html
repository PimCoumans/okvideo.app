          <p>Last updated: 10/06/2024</p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            pixelrock built the OK Video app as a Free app with Paid In-App
            Purchases. This SERVICE is provided by pixelrock at no cost, but
            includes extra features that are available for purchase, and is

            regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Log Data</h2>
          <p>
            OK Video does not contain any crash/analytics libraries. Whenever
            you use OK Video, in a case of an error in the app, Apple may send
            us the crash log. We only receive this Log Data when you have
            explicitly chosen to enable it in your iPhone’s Privacy settings.
            This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet
            Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and
            date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
            as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from
            the websites that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal
            memory. OK Video does not use these “cookies.” However, the app may
            link to external sites that use “cookies” to collect information and
            improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
            refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your
            device.
          </p>

          <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
          <p>
            OK Video may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
            third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
            external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise
            you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no
            control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
            policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

          <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>

            information from anyone. In the case we discover that someone has
            provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete
            it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
            child has provided us with personal information, please contact me
            so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
